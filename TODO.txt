Things to do

Get Data from Kaggle
Use Spark to read the data
Do data visualization
Do data preprocessing 
Perform Machine Learning on the Data/Use Text blob library 
Print the results / Print the graph and the counts between trump and biden

We need change classification to numbers - UDF lambda Function  - Positive , Negative and Neutral %Good we can get over without this:  1, -1, 0  
We need to write Global MLIB model which will use polarity and sentiment as features output multiclass classification to give us classification
We need to plot some graphs candidate wise. 

We need to work on report


Things Done

Get Data from Kaggle 
Read the data using spark and changed the schema accordingly
Concatinated the trump and biden into a single data
Done EDA
Done Preprocessing
We gotten the results using text blob
